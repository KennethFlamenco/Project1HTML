            Betty Elms (played by Naomi Watts), is a young aspiring actress who moves to Hollywood to chase her dream of
            being a big movie star. As she stays at her Aunt Ruth's place she finds another girl
            named Rita staying at her Aunt's house. But Rita has lost her memories and Betty is persistent on helping

            Rita (played by Laura Harring), we first see Rita in the back of a car where two men attempt to take her
            life but by luck crash the car which leaves Rita able to escape.
            But as Rita wakes up she cannot remember who she is and where she is. She soons reaches Aunt Ruth's house,
            where she sneaks in and settles down while Aunt Ruth vacates the home waiting for her neice to come.
            While she's there, Betty comes where they meet face to face and it is revealed that Rita does not know her
            own identity and only says her name is "Rita" because of a poster on the wall. Once Betty finds out it is
            Betty's mission to help Rita find out who she is, as the two spend
            more and more time together
            they soon develop feelings for each other.
