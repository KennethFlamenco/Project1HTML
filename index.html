            <p> Mulholland Drive, released in 2001, is a masterpiece and a defining peice of the 2000s. This movie has
                made me fall in love
                with the art of cinema, so I made a website dedicated to it. David Lynch, the director, has made
                mesmerising pieces of art over the years,
                Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Inland Empire, Twin Peaks and Twin Peaks <acronym
                    title="Fire Walk With Me">FWWM</acronym>. But Mulholland Drive is arguably his best work
                and maybe most impactful.
