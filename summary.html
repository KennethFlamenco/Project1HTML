                We follow a Limo driving through the darkness of the Hollywood hills. Two men in suits are sitting in
                the front while a dark haired woman is sitting in the back.
                The car stops and one of the men pulls out a silenced pistol and orders the woman to get out of the car.
                As one of the men come out the car to drag her out a car who was racing
                another car on the hills crashes into limo which causes both men to die instantly. The woman was thrown
                to the back of the seats and had hit her head causing her to start bleeding. After
                realizing what just happened she leaves the car and starts to walk through the trees and hills of
                Hollywood trying to get to safety. As she walks the streets she hides behind bushes and trees
                when she senses someone might see her.
