                We follow a Limo driving through the darkness of the Hollywood hills. Two men in suits are sitting in
                the front while a dark haired woman is sitting in the back.
                The car stops and one of the men pulls out a silenced pistol and orders the woman to get out of the car.
                As one of the men come out the car to drag her out a car who was racing
                another car on the hills crashes into limo which causes both men to die instantly. The woman was thrown
                to the back of the seats and had hit her head causing her to start bleeding. After
                realizing what just happened she leaves the car and starts to walk through the trees and hills of
                Hollywood trying to get to safety. As she walks the streets she hides behind bushes and trees
                when she senses someone might see her.

                As she wakes up she sees someone in front of the house shes hiding at packing her things into a taxi and
                when she looks away the woman sneaks into the house.
                We then see a diner where a man is telling his friend about a horrifying dream he had about seeing a man
                behind the diner and he came here to the exact
                diner in his dreams to see if the man is there. He explains that he had two of the same dreams and his
                friend was in both of them very afraid. They then walk out to the back of diner to confront his fear
                and then we he reaches the wall BOOM! a hideous man scares him causing him to collapse.

                We cut to the woman still sleeping as, a small man calls someone at the front desk telling him the girl
                is
                still missing. We then see a blonde woman named Betty arrive in Los Angeles at the airport and she is
                excited to
                finally be here. She kisses
                this elderly couple goodbye and they wish the best while she is here. As she leaves the elderly couple
                in the taxi have this eerly smile as they leave. Betty then arrives at the place she is staying at, its
                the same place the dark hair woman snuck into!
                She meets the manager and they have small talk as she escorts Betty into her new home. Betty then
                explores her new place joyfully and goes into the bathroom where she finds
                the dark hair woman showering she is startled and says she didn't know her Aunt Ruth had someone else
                living here. Betty asks for her name but she couldn't ansswer as she looks lost trying to remember her
                name.

                At a tall building, with a big sign called Ryan Entertainment, we see businessmen talking to a Director
                asking or urging him to cast a certain actress for his movie.
                We learn the direcot rname is Adam Kesher and that the woman they want him to cast is a blonde woman
                named Camilia Rhodes. As one man keeps saying this is the recommendation
                another man insists this is the girl and not a suggestion. As Kesher resists and says no way the man
                across from him stares deep into his eyes with a fierce intimidating look. After a series of weird tense
                strange events where the man
                drinks his expresso and spits it out, the room becomes loud and Kesher exclaims "that is not the girl!"
                while the man in a calm tone says "this is no longer your film." After Kesher leaves the building he
                finds the car that belong to the people
                that are taking over his film and destroy their car.
